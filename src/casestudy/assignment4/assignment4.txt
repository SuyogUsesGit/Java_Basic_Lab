Ans 1) Yes Inheritance is definitely a better approach to the problem as the differentiating factor between 2 common classes is the fares
	class structure: 
	Business Flights and Economy Flights extends Flight class
	First class train and Second class train extends Train class
	Non-AC and AC Bus extends Bus class.

Ans 2) Yes Inheritance can still be used because there are many attributes common in all of the classes such as:
	a) Each tour charges certain amount
	b) Each tour will have a certain amount of people
	c) Each tour will have a Calculate Charges method
	class structure:
	All 3 classes will extend from a base Travel class.
